 * 
 * the flow where the javascript run's
 * 
 * (code) --> (parser) --> (converting to the machine code) --> (code runs) 
 * 
 * Note : what is the parser 
 *      -> Means analyzing or coverting the code into the external format in which 
 *         the runtime env can actually run the code.
 *      -> For example Javascript inside the browsers.The browsers parse HTMl into the DOM Tree.
